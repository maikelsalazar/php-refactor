# E01 â€“ Discount Calculator

This exercise simulates an **e-commerce discount calculator** that determines the applicable discount based on user type and order details.

## ðŸ§© Problem Description

The goal of this exercise is to refactor an existing implementation that applies different discount rules depending on the type of user and order data.
The original code violates several clean code principles and makes it difficult to extend with new discount types without modifying existing logic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Refactor towards a **clean**, **extensible design**.
- Apply **SOLID principles**, especially Single Responsibility and Open/Closed.
- Improve **readability, testability, and separation of concerns**.
- Add **unit tests** to verify each behavior independently.
- Optionally, apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts if relevant.

## ðŸ“š Expected Outcome

A refactored solution that:
- Separates **domain logic** from orchestration.
- Is easy to extend with new **discount rules**.
- Is covered by meaningful, isolated **unit tests**.
